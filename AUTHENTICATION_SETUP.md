# 🔐 Complete Authentication Setup Guide

## Overview
Your authentication system now supports **Admin**, **Provider**, and **User** roles with Clerk integration and Supabase database.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Run the SQL script: `setup-admin-roles.sql`
3. This will:
   - Set up proper RLS policies
   - Configure admin role for `v9ibhav@gmail.com`
   - Create triggers for automatic role assignment

### Step 2: Clerk Authentication
1. **Sign up/Sign in** using Clerk:
   - Visit your app at `http://localhost:3001`
   - Click **"Sign In"** in the header
   - Use email: `v9ibhav@gmail.com`
   - Set any password you want (Clerk will handle it)

### Step 3: Verify Admin Access
1. After signing in, you should see a **"Dashboard"** dropdown in the header
2. Click it to access:
   - **Admin Dashboard** - Full system overview
   - **Manage Users** - User management
   - **Manage Services** - Service administration
   - **View Bookings** - Booking oversight

## 🎯 How It Works

### Authentication Flow
1. **Clerk** handles the login/signup process
2. **AuthContext** fetches user role from Supabase
3. **RoleProtected** component guards admin routes
4. **Header** shows role-based navigation options

### Role System
- **Admin** (`v9ibhav@gmail.com`): Full system access
- **Provider**: Access to provider dashboard + own bookings
- **User**: Standard user access + personal dashboard

### Email-Based Role Assignment
- `v9ibhav@gmail.com` → Automatically gets **admin** role
- Other emails → Get **user** role by default
- Roles can be manually changed in Supabase dashboard
